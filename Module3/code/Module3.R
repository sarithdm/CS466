#Ordered and unordered factors
#A factor is a vector object used to specify a discrete classification (grouping) of the components
#of other vectors of the same length
#R provides both ordered and unordered factors.
#4.1 A specific example
#Suppose, for example, we have a sample of 30 tax accountants from all the states and territories
#of Australia1 and their individual state of origin is specified by a character vector of state
#mnemonics as
state <- c("tas", "sa", "qld", "nsw", "nsw", "nt", "wa", "wa",
           "qld", "vic", "nsw", "vic", "qld", "qld", "sa", "tas",
           "sa", "nt", "wa", "vic", "qld", "nsw", "nsw", "wa",
           "sa", "act", "nsw", "vic", "vic", "act")
#Notice that in the case of a character vector, "sorted" means sorted in alphabetical order.
# factor is similarly created using the factor() function:
statef <- factor(state)
statef

#To find out the levels of a factor the function levels() can be used.
levels(statef)
#4.2 The function tapply() and ragged arrays
#suppose we have the incomes of the same tax accountants in
#another vector (in suitably large units of money)
incomes <- c(60, 49, 40, 61, 64, 60, 59, 54, 62, 69, 70, 42, 56,
             61, 61, 61, 58, 51, 48, 65, 49, 49, 41, 48, 52, 46,
             59, 46, 58, 43)
incomes
#To calculate the sample mean income for each state we can now use the special function
#tapply():
incmeans <- tapply(incomes, statef, mean)
incmeans
#Suppose further we needed to calculate the standard errors of the state income means.
stderr <- function(x) sqrt(var(x)/length(x))
incster <- tapply(incomes, statef, stderr)
incster
#4.3 Ordered factors
#Sometimes the levels will have a natural ordering that we want to record and want our
#statistical analysis to make use of. The ordered() function creates such ordered factors but
#is otherwise identical to factor
stateo <- ordered(state)
stateo

#5 Arrays and matrices
#An array can be considered as a multiply subscripted collection of data entries, for example
#numeric.

#A dimension vector is a vector of non-negative integers. If its length is k then the array is
#k-dimensional, e.g. a matrix is a 2-dimensional array. The dimensions are indexed from one up
#to the values given in the dimension vector
#A vector can be used by R as an array only if it has a dimension vector as its dim attribute.
#Suppose, for example, z is a vector of 1500 elements.
#> dim(z) <- c(3,5,100)
#For example if the dimension vector for an array, say a, is c(3,4,2) then there are 3  4 
#2 = 24 entries in a and the data vector holds them in the order a[1,1,1], a[2,1,1], ...,
#a[2,4,2], a[3,4,2].
#in that order. a[,,] stands for the entire array, which is the same as omitting the subscripts
#entirely and using a alone
a <- array(1:20)
a
a[1]
a[20]
a[-1]
#5.3 Index matrices
x <- array(1:20, dim=c(4,5))

y <- array(21:40, dim=c(4,5))

#5.5 The outer product of two arrays
#If a and b are two numeric arrays,
#their outer product is an array whose dimension vector is obtained by concatenating their two
#dimension vectors (order is important), and whose data vector is got by forming all possible
#products of elements of the data vector of a with those of b.
